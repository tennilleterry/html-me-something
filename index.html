I liked reading novels, story books.I wasn't the type of kid to go outside and play, Id rather get lost in another world. I would often use people I knew or my favorite movie stars as the characters in the book. Sometimes I imagined myself as the characters. I can create a movie in my head.</p></div>

Fiction is occasionally used in its narrowest sense to mean simply any "literary narrative".</p></li></div>
